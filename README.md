# ASO Data Processing Files
This Repo includes the main data scripts used for analysis in the presentation and report
1. Python notebooks containing the code used by the project members to create graphs and tables
2. Excel tables containing the weighted averages and most common prices per events and sections (these were used for the first pricing strategy).
3. Python script used to generate these tables, that can be downloaded and easily modified in case of further analysis needed for coming year's data. 

If you have any questions, we're happy to help: please refer to the professor's email address provided in the report.
